In this chapter, you'll learn how to write integration tests for workflows using [medusaIntegrationTestRunner](../page.mdx) from Medusa's Testing Framwork.

## Write Integration Test for Workflow

Consider you have the following workflow defined at `src/workflows/hello-world.ts`:

```ts title="src/workflows/hello-world.ts"
import {
  createWorkflow,
  createStep,
  StepResponse,
  WorkflowResponse,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"

const step1 = createStep("step-1", () => {
  return new StepResponse("Hello, World!")
})

export const helloWorldWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world-workflow",
  () => {
    const message = step1()

    return new WorkflowResponse(message)
  }
)
```

To write a test for this workflow, create the file `integration-tests/http/workflow.spec.ts` with the following content:

```ts title="integration-tests/http/workflow.spec.ts"
import { medusaIntegrationTestRunner } from "@medusajs/test-utils"
import { helloWorldWorkflow } from "../../src/workflows/hello-world"

medusaIntegrationTestRunner({
  testSuite: ({ getContainer }) => {
    describe("Test hello-world workflow", () => {
      it("returns message", async () => {
        const { result } = await helloWorldWorkflow(getContainer())
          .run()

        expect(result).toEqual("Hello, World!")
      })
    })
  },
})

jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

You use the `medusaIntegrationTestRunner` to write an integration test for the workflow. The test pases if the workflow returns the string `"Hello, World!"`.

### Jest Timeout

Since your tests connect to the database and perform actions that require more time than the typical tests, make sure to increase the timeout in your test:

```ts title="integration-tests/http/custom-routes.spec.ts"
// in your test's file
jest.setTimeout(60 * 1000)
```

---

## Run Test

Run the following command to run your tests:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run test:integration
```

<Note title="Tip">

If you don't have a `test:integration` script in `package.json`, refer to the [Medusa Testing Tools chapter](../../page.mdx#add-test-commands).

</Note>

This runs your Medusa application and runs the tests available under the `integrations/http` directory.

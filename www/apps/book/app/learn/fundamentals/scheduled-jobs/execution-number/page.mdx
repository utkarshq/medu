export const metadata = {
  title: `${pageNumber} Scheduled Jobs Number of Executions`,
}

# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to set a limit on the number of times a scheduled job is executed.

## numberOfExecutions Option

The export configuration object of the scheduled job accepts an optional property `numberOfExecutions`. Its value is a number indicating how many times the scheduled job can be executed during the Medusa application's runtime.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["9", "numberOfExecutions", "The number of times the job should be executed."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
export default async function myCustomJob() {
  console.log("I'll be executed three times only.")
}

export const config = {
  name: "hello-world",
  // execute every minute
  schedule: "* * * * *",
  numberOfExecutions: 3,
}
```

The above scheduled job has the `numberOfExecutions` configuration set to `3`.

So, it'll only execute 3 times, each every minute, then it won't be executed anymore.

<Note>

If you restart the Medusa application, the scheduled job will be executed again until reaching the number of executions specified.

# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to execute an action based on a condition in a workflow using when-then from the Workflows SDK.

## Why If-Conditions Aren't Allowed in Workflows?

Medusa creates an internal representation of the workflow definition you pass to `createWorkflow` to track and store its steps. At that point, variables in the workflow don't have any values. They only do when you execute the workflow.

So, you can't use an if-condition that checks a variable's value, as the condition will be evaluated when Medusa creates the internal representation of the workflow, rather than during execution.

Instead, use when-then from the Workflows SDK. It allows you to perform steps in a workflow only if a condition that you specify is satisified.

---

## How to use When-Then?

The Workflows SDK provides a `when` function that is used to check whether a condition is true. You chain a `then` function to `when` that specifies the steps to execute if the condition in `when` is satisfied.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["15", "input", "The data to pass as a parameter to the function in the second parameter"],
  ["17", "return", "The function must return a boolean value indicating whether\nthe callback function passed to `then` should be executed."],
  ["19", "() => {", "The function to execute if `when`'s second parameter returns a `true` value."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  when,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "workflow", 
  function (input: {
    is_active: boolean
  }) {

    const result = when(
      input, 
      (input) => {
        return input.is_active
      }
    ).then(() => {
      const stepResult = isActiveStep()
      return stepResult
    })

    // executed without condition
    const anotherStepResult = anotherStep(result)

    return new WorkflowResponse(
      anotherStepResult
    )
  }
)
```

In this code snippet, you execute the `isActiveStep` only if the `input.is_active`'s value is `true`.

### When Parameters

`when` accepts the following parameters:

1. The first parameter is either an object or the workflow's input. This data is passed as a parameter to the function in `when`'s second parameter.
2. The second parameter is a function that returns a boolean indicating whether to execute the action in `then`.

### Then Parameters

To specify the action to perform if the condition is satisfied, chain a `then` function to `when` and pass it a callback function.

The callback function is only executed if `when`'s second parameter function returns a `true` value.

## Implementing If-Else with When-Then

when-then doesn't support if-else conditions. Instead, use two `when-then` conditions in your workflow.

For example:

export const ifElseHighlights = [
  ["7", "when", "This when-then block acts as an if condition."],
  ["16", "when", "This when-then block acts as an else condiiton."]
]

```ts highlights={ifElseHighlights}
const workflow = createWorkflow(
  "workflow", 
  function (input: {
    is_active: boolean
  }) {

    const isActiveResult = when(
      input, 
      (input) => {
        return input.is_active
      }
    ).then(() => {
      return isActiveStep()
    })

    const notIsActiveResult = when(
      input,
      (input) => {
        return input.is_active
      }
    ).then(() => {
      return notIsActiveStep()
    })

    // ...
  }
)
```

In the above workflow, you use two `when-then` blocks. The first one performs a step if `input.is_active` is `true`, and the second performs a step if `input.is_active` is `false`, acting as an else condition.

---

## Specify Name for When-Then

Internally, `when-then` blocks have a unique name similar to a step. When you return a step's result in a `when-then` block, the block's name is derived from the step's name. For example:

```ts
const isActiveResult = when(
  input, 
  (input) => {
    return input.is_active
  }
).then(() => {
  return isActiveStep()
})
```

This `when-then` block's internal name will be `when-then-is-active`, where `is-active` is the step's name.

However, if you need to return in your `when-then` block something other than a step's result, you need to specify a unique step name for that block. Otherwise, Medusa will generate a random name for it which can cause unexpected errors in production.

You pass a name for `when-then` as a first parameter of `when`, whose signature can accept three parameters in this case. For example:

export const nameHighlights = [
  ["2", `"check-is-active"`, "The when-then block's name."],
  ["10", "return", "`then` returns a value other than the step's result."]
]

```ts highlights={nameHighlights}
const { isActive } = when(
  "check-is-active",
  input, 
  (input) => {
    return input.is_active
  }
).then(() => {
  const isActive = isActiveStep()

  return {
    isActive,
  }
})
```

Since `then` returns a value different than the step's result, you pass to the `when` function the following parameters:

1. A unique name to be assigned to the `when-then` block.
2. Either an object or the workflow's input. This data is passed as a parameter to the function in `when`'s second parameter.
3. A function that returns a boolean indicating whether to execute the action in `then`.

The second and third parameters are the same as the parameters you previously passed to `when`.

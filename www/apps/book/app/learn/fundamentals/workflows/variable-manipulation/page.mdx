# {metadata.title}

In this chapter, you'll learn how to use `transform` from the Workflows SDK to manipulate variables in a workflow.

## Why Variable Manipulation isn't Allowed in Workflows

Medusa creates an internal representation of the workflow definition you pass to `createWorkflow` to track and store its steps.

At that point, variables in the workflow don't have any values. They only do when you execute the workflow.

So, you can only pass variables as parameters to steps. But, in a workflow, you can't change a variable's value or, if the variable is an array, loop over its items.

Instead, use `transform` from the Workflows SDK.

## What is the transform Utility?

`transform` creates a new variable as the result of manipulating other variables.

For example, consider you have two strings as the output of two steps:

```ts
const str1 = step1()
const str2 = step2()
```

To concatenate the strings, you create a new variable `str3` using the `transform` function:

export const highlights = [
  ["14", "str3", "Holds the result returned by `transform`'s second parameter function."],
  ["15", "", "Specify the data to pass as a parameter to the function in the second parameter."],
  ["16", "data", "The data passed in the first parameter of `transform`."],
  ["16", "`${data.str1}${data.str2}`", "Return the concatenated strings."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  transform,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
    const str1 = step1(input)
    const str2 = step2(input)

    const str3 = transform(
      { str1, str2 },
      (data) => `${data.str1}${data.str2}`
    )

    return new WorkflowResponse(str3)
  }
)
```

`transform` accepts two parameters:

1. The first parameter is an object of variables to manipulate. The object is passed as a parameter to `transform`'s second parameter function.
2. The second parameter is the function performing the variable manipulation.

The value returned by the second parameter function is returned by `transform`. So, the `str3` variable holds the concatenated string.

You can use the returned value in the rest of the workflow, either to pass it as an input to other steps or to return it in the workflow's response.

---

## Example: Looping Over Array

Use `transform` to loop over arrays to create another variable from the array's items.

For example:

```ts collapsibleLines="1-7" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
import { 
  createWorkflow,
  WorkflowResponse,
  transform,
} from "@medusajs/framework/workflows-sdk"
// step imports...

type WorkflowInput = {
  items: {
    id: string
    name: string
  }[]
}

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function ({ items }: WorkflowInput) {
    const ids = transform(
      { items },
      (data) => data.items.map((item) => item.id)
    )
    
    doSomethingStep(ids)

    // ...
  }
)
```

This workflow receives an `items` array in its input.

You use `transform` to create an `ids` variable, which is an array of strings holding the `id` of each item in the `items` array.

You then pass the `ids` variable as a parameter to the `doSomethingStep`.

## Example: Creating a Date

If you create a date with `new Date()` in a workflow's constructor function, Medusa evaluates the date's value when it creates the internal representation of the workflow, not when the workflow is executed.

So, use `transform` instead to create a date variable with `new Date()`.

For example:

```ts
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world",
  () => {
    const today = transform({}, () => new Date())

    doSomethingStep(today)
  }
)
```

In this workflow, `today` is only evaluated when the workflow is executed.

---

## Caveats

### Transform Evaluation

`transform`'s value is only evaluated if you pass its output to a step or in the workflow response.

For example, if you have the following workflow:

```ts
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
    const str = transform(
      { input },
      (data) => `${data.input.str1}${data.input.str2}`
    )

    return new WorkflowResponse("done")
  }
)
```

Since `str`'s value isn't used as a step's input or passed to `WorkflowResponse`, its value is never evaluated.

### Data Validation

`transform` should only be used to perform variable or data manipulation.

If you want to perform some validation on the data, use a step or [when-then](../conditions/page.mdx) instead.

For example:

```ts
// DON'T
const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
    const str = transform(
      { input },
      (data) => {
        if (!input.str1) {
          throw new Error("Not allowed!")
        }
      }
    )
  }
)

// DO
const validateHasStr1Step = createStep(
  "validate-has-str1",
  ({ input }) => {
    if (!input.str1) {
      throw new Error("Not allowed!")
    }
  }
)

const myWorkflow = createWorkflow(
  "hello-world", 
  function (input) {
    validateHasStr1({
      input,
    })

    // workflow continues its execution only if 
    // the step doesn't throw the error.
  }
)
```

In this chapter, youâ€™ll learn how to define relationships between data models in your module.

## What is a Relationship Property?

A relationship property defines an association in the database between two models. It's created using the Data Model Language (DML) methods, such as `hasOne` or `belongsTo`.

When you generate a migration for these data models, the migrations include foreign key columns or pivot tables, based on the relationship's type.

## One-to-One Relationship

A one-to-one relationship indicates that one record of a data model belongs to or is associated with another.

To define a one-to-one relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the following methods:

1. `hasOne`: indicates that the model has one records of the specified model.
2. `belongsTo`: indicates that the model belongs to one record of the specified model.

For example:

export const oneToOneHighlights = [
  ["5", "hasOne", "A user has one email."],
  ["10", "belongsTo", "An email belongs to a user."],
  ["11", `"email"`, "The relationship's name in the `User` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={oneToOneHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const User = model.define("user", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  email: model.hasOne(() => Email),
})

const Email = model.define("email", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  user: model.belongsTo(() => User, {
    mappedBy: "email",
  }),
})
```

In the example above, a user has one email, and an email belongs to one user.

The `hasOne` and `belongsTo` methods accept a function as a first parameter. The function returns the associated data model.

The `belongsTo` method also requires passing as a second parameter an object with the property `mappedBy`. Its value is the name of the relationship property in the other data model.

### Optional Relationship

To make the relationship optional on the `hasOne` or `belongsTo` side, use the `nullable` method on either properties as explained in [this chapter](../configure-properties/page.mdx#nullable-property).

### One-to-One Relationship in the Database

When you generate the migrations of data models that have a one-to-one relationship, the migration adds to the table of the data model that has the `belongsTo` property:

1. A column of the format `{relation_name}_id` to store the ID of the record of the related data model. For example, the `email` table will have a `user_id` column.
2. A foreign key on the `{relation_name}_id` column to the table of the related data model.

## One-to-Many Relationship

A one-to-many relationship indicates that one record of a data model has many records of another data model.

To define a one-to-many relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the following methods:

1. `hasMany`: indicates that the model has more than one records of the specified model.
2. `belongsTo`: indicates that the model belongs to one record of the specified model.

For example:

export const oneToManyHighlights = [
  ["5", "hasMany", "A store has many products"],
  ["10", "belongsTo", "A product has one store."],
  ["11", `"products"`, "The relationship's name in the `Store` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={oneToManyHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  store: model.belongsTo(() => Store, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

In this example, a store has many products, but a product belongs to one store.

### Optional Relationship

To make the relationship optional on the `belongsTo` side, use the `nullable` method on the property as explained in [this chapter](../configure-properties/page.mdx#nullable-property).

### One-to-Many Relationship in the Database

When you generate the migrations of data models that have a one-to-many relationship, the migration adds to the table of the data model that has the `belongsTo` property:

1. A column of the format `{relation_name}_id` to store the ID of the record of the related data model. For example, the `product` table will have a `store_id` column.
2. A foreign key on the `{relation_name}_id` column to the table of the related data model.

![Diagram illustrating the relation between a store and product records in the database](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1726733937/Medusa%20Book/one-to-many_d6wtcw.jpg)

## Many-to-Many Relationship

A many-to-many relationship indicates that many records of a data model can be associated to many records of another data model.

To define a many-to-many relationship, create relationship properties in the data models using the `manyToMany` method.

For example:

export const manyToManyHighlights = [
  ["5", "manyToMany", "An order is associated with many products."],
  ["12", "manyToMany", "A product is associated with many orders."]
]

```ts highlights={manyToManyHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const Order = model.define("order", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.manyToMany(() => Product, {
    mappedBy: "orders",
    pivotTable: "order_product",
    joinColumn: "order_id",
    inverseJoinColumn: "product_id",
  }),
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  orders: model.manyToMany(() => Order, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

The `manyToMany` method accepts two parameters:

1. A function that returns the associated data model.
2. An object of optional configuration. Only one of the data models in the relation can define the `pivotTable`, `joinColumn`, and `inverseJoinColumn` configurations, and it's considered the owner data model. The object can accept the following properties:
    - `mappedBy`: The name of the relationship property in the other data model. If not set, the property's name is inferred from the associated data model's name.
    - `pivotTable`: The name of the pivot table created in the database for the many-to-many relation. If not set, the pivot table is inferred by combining the names of the data models' tables in alphabetical order, seperating them by `_`, and pluralizing the last name. For example, `order_products`.
    - `joinColumn`: The name of the column in the pivot table that points to the owner model's primary key.
    - `inverseJoinColumn`: The name of the column in the pivot table that points to the owned model's primary key.

<Note>

The `pivotTable`, `joinColumn`, and `inverseJoinColumn` property are only available after [Medusa v2.0.7](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.0.7).

</Note>

<Note>

Following [Medusa v2.1.0](https://github.com/medusajs/medusa/releases/tag/v2.1.0), if `pivotTable`, `joinColumn`, and `inverseJoinColumn` aren't specified on either models, the owner is decided based on alphabetical order. So, in the example above, the `Order` data model would be the owner.

</Note>

In this example, an order is associated with many products, and a product is associated with many orders. Since the `pivotTable`, `joinColumn`, and `inverseJoinColumn` configurations are defined on the order, it's considered the owner data model.

### Many-to-Many Relationship in the Database

When you generate the migrations of data models that have a many-to-many relationship, the migration adds a new pivot table. Its name is either the name you specify in the `pivotTable` configuration, or the inferred name combining the names of the data models' tables in alphabetical order, seperating them by `_`, and pluralizing the last name. For example, `order_products`.

The pivot table has a column with the name `{data_model}_id` for each of the data model's tables. It also has foreign keys on each of these columns to their respective tables.

The pivot table has columns with foreign keys pointing to the primary key of the associated tables. The column's name is either:

- The value of the `joinColumn` configuration for the owner table, and the `inverseJoinColumn` configuration for the owned table;
- Or the inferred name `{table_name}_id`.

![Diagram illustrating the relation between order and product records in the database](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1726734269/Medusa%20Book/many-to-many_fzy5pq.jpg)

### Many-To-Many with Custom Columns

To add custom columns to the pivot table between two data models having a many-to-many relationship, you must define a new data model that represents the pivot table.

For example:

export const manyToManyColumnHighlights = [
  ["5", "products", "Many-to-many relation to the `Product` data model."],
  ["6", "pivotEntity", "Specify the data model representing the pivot table."],
  ["12", "orders", "Many-to-many relation to the `Order` data model."],
  ["15", "OrderProduct", "Data model that represents the pivot table between orders and products."],
  ["17", "order", "Relation to the Order data model."],
  ["20", "product", "Relation to the Product data model."],
  ["23", "metadata", "Extra column in the pivot table."]
]

```ts highlights={manyToManyColumnHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils";

export const Order = model.define("order_test", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.manyToMany(() => Product, {
    pivotEntity: () => OrderProduct
  })
})

export const Product = model.define("product_test", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  orders: model.manyToMany(() => Order)
})

export const OrderProduct = model.define("orders_products", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  order: model.belongsTo(() => Order, {
    mappedBy: "products"
  }),
  product: model.belongsTo(() => Product, {
    mappedBy: "orders"
  }),
  metadata: model.json().nullable()
})
```

The `Order` and `Product` data models have a many-to-many relationship. To add extra columns to the created pivot table, you pass a `pivotEntity` option to the `products` relation in `Order` (since `Order` is the owner). The value of `pivotEntity` is a function that returns the data model representing the pivot table.

The `OrderProduct` model defines, aside from the ID, the following properties:

- `order`: A relation that indicates this model belongs to the `Order` data model. You set the `mappedBy` option to the many-to-many relation's name in the `Order` data model.
- `product`: A relation that indicates this model belongs to the `Product` data model. You set the `mappedBy` option to the many-to-many relation's name in the `Product` data model.
- `metadata`: An extra column to add to the pivot table of type `json`. You can add other columns as well to the model.

---

## Set Relationship Name in the Other Model

The relationship property methods accept as a second parameter an object of options. The `mappedBy` property defines the name of the relationship in the other data model.

This is useful if the relationship propertyâ€™s name is different than that of the associated data model.

As seen in previous examples, the `mappedBy` option is required for the `belongsTo` method.

For example:

export const relationNameHighlights = [
  ["6", `"owner"`, "The relationship's name in the `Email` data model."],
  ["13", `"email"`, "The relationship's name in the `User` data model."]
]

```ts highlights={relationNameHighlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const User = model.define("user", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  email: model.hasOne(() => Email, {
    mappedBy: "owner",
  }),
})

const Email = model.define("email", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  owner: model.belongsTo(() => User, {
    mappedBy: "email",
  }),
})
```

In this example, you specify in the `User` data modelâ€™s relationship property that the name of the relationship in the `Email` data model is `owner`.

## Cascades

When an operation is performed on a data model, such as record deletion, the relationship cascade specifies what related data model records should be affected by it.

For example, if a store is deleted, its products should also be deleted.

The `cascades` method used on a data model configures which child records an operation is cascaded to.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["8", "", "When a store is deleted, delete its associated products."]
]

```ts highlights={highlights}
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const Store = model.define("store", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  products: model.hasMany(() => Product),
})
.cascades({
  delete: ["products"],
})

const Product = model.define("product", {
  id: model.id().primaryKey(),
  store: model.belongsTo(() => Store, {
    mappedBy: "products",
  }),
})
```

The `cascades` method accepts an object. Its key is the operationâ€™s name, such as `delete`. The value is an array of relationship property names that the operation is cascaded to.

In the example above, when a store is deleted, its associated products are also deleted.

# {metadata.title}

The previous guides introduced Medusa's different concepts and how you can use them to customize Medusa for a realistic use case, You added brands to your application, linked them to products, customized the admin dashboard, and integrated a third-party CMS.

The next chapters will cover each of these concepts in depth, with the different ways you can use them, their options or configurations, and more advanced features that weren't covered in the previous guides. While you can start building with Medusa, it's highly recommended to follow the next chapters for a better understanding of Medusa's fundamentals.

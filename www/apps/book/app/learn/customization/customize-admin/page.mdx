# {metadata.title}

In the previous chapters, you've customized your Medusa application to [add brands](../custom-features/module/page.mdx), [expose an API route to create brands](../custom-features/api-route/page.mdx), and [linked brands to products](../extend-features/define-link/page.mdx).

After customizing and extending your application with new features, you may need to provide an interface for admin users to utilize these features. The Medusa Admin dashboard is extendable, allowing you to:

- Insert components, called [widgets](../../fundamentals/admin/widgets/page.mdx), on existing pages.
- Add new pages, called [UI Routes](../../fundamentals/admin/ui-routes/page.mdx).

From these customizations, you can send requests to custom API routes, allowing admin users to manage custom resources on the dashboard

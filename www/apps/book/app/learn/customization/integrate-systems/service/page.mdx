# {metadata.title}

In the previous chapters, you've created a [Brand Module](../../custom-features/module/page.mdx) that adds brands to your application. In this chapter, you'll integrate a dummy Content-Management System (CMS) in a new module. The module's service will provide methods to retrieve and manage brands in the CMS. You'll later use this service to sync data from and to the CMS.

<Note>

Learn more about modules in [this chapter](../../../fundamentals/modules/page.mdx).

</Note>

## 1. Create Module Directory

You'll integrate the third-party system in a new CMS Module. So, create the directory `src/modules/cms` that will hold the module's resources.

![Directory structure after adding the directory for the CMS Module](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733492447/Medusa%20Book/cms-dir-overview-1_gasguk.jpg)

---

## 2. Create Module Service

Next, you'll create the module's service. It will provide methods to connect and perform actions with the third-party system.

Create the CMS Module's service at `src/modules/cms/service.ts` with the following content:

![Directory structure after adding the CMS Module's service](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733492583/Medusa%20Book/cms-dir-overview-2_zwcwh3.jpg)

export const serviceHighlights = [
  ["3", "ModuleOptions", "The options that the CMS Module receives."],
  ["7", "InjectedDependencies", "The dependencies injected into the service from the module's container."],
  ["16", "logger", "Dependencies injected from the module's container"],
  ["16", "options", "Options passed to the module in the configurations."]
]

```ts title="src/modules/cms/service.ts" highlights={serviceHighlights}
import { Logger, ConfigModule } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

export type ModuleOptions = {
  apiKey: string
}

type InjectedDependencies = {
  logger: Logger
  configModule: ConfigModule
}

class CmsModuleService {
  private options_: ModuleOptions
  private logger_: Logger

  constructor({ logger }: InjectedDependencies, options: ModuleOptions) {
    this.logger_ = logger
    this.options_ = options

    // TODO initialize SDK
  }
}

export default CmsModuleService
```

You create a `CmsModuleService` that will hold the methods to connect to the third-party CMS. A service's constructor accepts two parameters:

1. The module's container. Since a module is [isolated](../../../fundamentals/modules/isolation/page.mdx), it has a [local container](../../../fundamentals/modules/container/page.mdx) different than the Medusa container you use in other customizations. This container holds framework tools like the [Logger utility](../../../debugging-and-testing/logging/page.mdx) and resources within the module.
2. Options passed to the module when it's later added in Medusa's configurations. These options are useful to pass secret keys or configurations that ensure your module is re-usable across applications. For the CMS Module, you accept the API key to connect to the dummy CMS as an option.

When integrating a third-party system that has a Node.js SDK or client, you can initialize that client in the constructor to be used in the service's methods.

### Integration Methods

Next, you'll add methods that simulate sending requests to a third-party CMS. You'll use these methods later to sync brands from and to the CMS.

Add the following methods in the `CmsModuleService`:

export const methodsHighlights = [
  ["6", "sendRequest", "Since the third-party system isn't real, this method only logs a message."],
  ["12", "createBrand", "A method that creates a brand in the third-party system."],
  ["16", "deleteBrand", "A method that deletes a brand in the third-party system."],
  ["20", "retrieveBrands", "A method that retrieves a brand from a third-party system."]
]

```ts title="src/modules/cms/service.ts" highlights={methodsHighlights}
export class BrandClient {
  // ...

  // a dummy method to simulate sending a request,
  // in a realistic scenario, you'd use an SDK, fetch, or axios clients
  private async sendRequest(url: string, method: string, data?: any) {
    this.logger_.info(`Sending a ${method} request to ${url}.`)
    this.logger_.info(`Request Data: ${JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}`)
    this.logger_.info(`API Key: ${JSON.stringify(this.options_.apiKey, null, 2)}`)
  }

  async createBrand(brand: Record<string, unknown>) {
    await this.sendRequest("/brands", "POST", brand)
  }

  async deleteBrand(id: string) {
    await this.sendRequest(`/brands/${id}`, "DELETE")
  }

  async retrieveBrands(): Promise<Record<string, unknown>[]> {
    await this.sendRequest("/brands", "GET")

    return []
  }
}
```

The `sendRequest` method sends requests to the third-party CMS. Since this guide isn't using a real CMS, it only simulates the sending by logging messages in the terminal.

You also add three methods that use the `sendRequest` method:

- `createBrand` that creates a brand in the third-party system.
- `deleteBrand` that deletes the brand in the third-party system.
- `retrieveBrands` to retrieve a brand from the third-party system.

## 3. Export Module Definition

After creating the module's service, you'll export the module definition indicating the module's name and service.

Create the file `src/modules/cms/index.ts` with the following content:

![Directory structure of the Medusa application after adding the module definition file](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1733492991/Medusa%20Book/cms-dir-overview-3_b0byks.jpg)

```ts title="src/modules/cms/index.ts"
import { Module } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
import CmsModuleService from "./service"

export const CMS_MODULE = "cms"

export default Module(CMS_MODULE, {
  service: CmsModuleService,
})
```

You use `Module` from the Modules SDK to export the module's defintion, indicating that the module's name is `cms` and its service is `CmsModuleService`.

---

## 4. Add Module to Medusa's Configurations

Finally, add the module to the Medusa configurations at `medusa-config.ts`:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  // ...
  modules: [
    // ...
    {
      resolve: "./src/modules/cms",
      options: {
        apiKey: process.env.CMS_API_KEY,
      },
    },
  ], 
})
```

The object passed in `modules` accept an `options` property, whose value is an object of options to pass to the module. These are the options you receive in the `CmsModuleService`'s constructor.

You can add the `CMS_API_KEY` environment variable to `.env`:

```bash
CMS_API_KEY=123
```

---

## Next Steps: Sync Brand From Medusa to CMS

You can now use the CMS Module's service to perform actions on the third-party CMS.

In the next chapter, you'll learn how to emit an event when a brand is created, then handle that event to sync the brand from Medusa to the third-party service.

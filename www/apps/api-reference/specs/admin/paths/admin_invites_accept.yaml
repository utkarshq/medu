    Accept an invite and create a new user.

    Since the user isn't created yet, the JWT token used in the authorization
    header is retrieved from the `/auth/user/emailpass/register` API route (or a
    provider other than `emailpass`). The user can then authenticate using the
    `/auth/user/emailpass` API route.
  x-authenticated: false

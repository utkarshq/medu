## Overview

You can create discounts of different types in Medusa that customers use on checkout:

- **Percentage Discounts** to deduct a percentage of the total amount of an order.
- **Fixed Discounts** to deduct a fixed amount from the total amount of an order.
- **Free Shipping** to override the delivery amount of an order and make it free.

Discounts are in the form of a code that your customers use. Discounts have conditions and options, such as start and end dates, or what products is the discount applied to.

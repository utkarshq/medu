## Tour of Medusa Admin

After you log into your Medusa Admin, you see a sidebar menu to the left, a search bar at the top, some icons at the top right, and in the middle the content of the page you’re currently on.

### Sidebar Menu

The sidebar menu includes the main navigation of your Medusa Admin. You can use it to navigate between different pages, such as Products or Orders pages.

You can hide the sidebar by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={SidebarLeft} alt="sidebar" /> icon at the top next to the sidebar. Clicking it again shows the sidebar.

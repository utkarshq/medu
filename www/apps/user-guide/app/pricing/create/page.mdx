In this document, youâ€™ll learn how to create a price list.

{/* TODO check for correctness */}

To create a price list:

1. Go to the Pricing page.
2. Click on the Create button.
3. A form opens to create a price list. The form is split into three steps:
    1. In the first step:
        1. Under the Type section, choose the price list's type. It can be either Sale or Override.
        2. Enter the title and description of the price list in their respective fields.
        3. If the prices in the price list include taxes, enable the "Tax inclusive prices" field.
        4. If the price list has a start or end date, set those in their respective fields.
        5. To limit which customer groups can use the price list, enable the "Customer availability" field and check the checkbox next to the customer groups allowed to use the price list.
        6. Once you're done, click the Continue button.
    2. In the second step, choose the products that the price list applies to. Once you're done, click the Continue button.
    3. In the third step, enter the price of each product variant. The price editor uses the [bulk editor](../../tips/bulk-editor/page.mdx).
        - To add a currency, click on the "Add currency" button and select the currency.
4. Once you're done, click the Save button.

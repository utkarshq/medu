In this document, you’ll get an overview of lists in Medusa including filters, searching, and more!

## Filter Items

Use filters to retrieve items in a list matching specific criteria.

{/* TODO check if the next section still applies */}

{/* ### Quick Filters

On a table with a list of items, you’ll find quick filters at the top of the list.

You can click on one of these filters to quickly apply it to the list of items.

To do that:

1. Click on the "Add filter" button at the top of the list.
2. From the dropdown, choose the criteria you want to filter.
3. This shows a new set of values to filter the list by.
4. After selecting the value, the list only includes the items matching your filters. You can also apply multiple filters.

The filters you create are saved and are applied everytime you view the same list.

### Edit Saved Filters

To edit a saved filter:

1. Click on the filter.
2. Choose the new value of the filter.

### Delete Saved Filters

### Clear Filters

To clear all applied filters, click on the "Clear all" link at the end of the list of filters.

## Multiple Pages

Lists in the Medusa Admin span across multiple pages if the number of items in that list are more than twenty. 

Navigate between pages using the "Prev" and "Next" buttons at the bottom of the list.

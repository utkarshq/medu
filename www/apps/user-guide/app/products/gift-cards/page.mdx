## Types of Gift Cards

In the Medusa Admin, there are two types of gift cards:

- **Product gift card**: A gift card that customers can purchase in your store.
- **Customer gift card**: A gift card that admin users create for a specific customer email. This gift card can't be purchased by other customers.

As for product gift cards, they're displayed in the Products page. You can view them either by:

{/* TODO check filter name */}

- Clicking the "View gift card products" button in the Gift Cards page.

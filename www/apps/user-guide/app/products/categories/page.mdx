In this document, you’ll learn how to create a category, edit existing categories, delete a category, and more.

## Create a Category

{/* TODO check for correctness */}

To create a product category:

1. Go to the Product → Categories page.
2. Click on the “Create” button at the top right.
3. In the form that opens, there are two steps:
    1. In the first step:
      1. Enter the category's name in the Title field. This is the only required field.
      2. In the Handle field, enter a dash (`-`) separated string that's used as part of the category's URL when the customer views it on the storefront. If not specified, the handle is generated from the Title field's value.
      3. Optionally set the category's description in the Description field.
      4. In the Status field, you can change the status to “Inactive” if you’re creating the category, but you’re still not ready to use it.
      5. In the Visibility field, you can change the visibility to “Private” if you’re creating an internal category that shouldn’t be shown to the customer.
      6. Optionally, you can add under the Metadata section additional information in key-value pairs.
      7. Once you're done, click the "Continue" button.
    2. In the second step, you can nest the new category within other categories. To move categories around, use the <InlineIcon Icon={DotsSix} alt="drag" /> icon to drag categories to their correct position.
4. Once you’re done, click the Save button.

## Edit a Category

3. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon in the first section of the category page.
4. Choose Edit from the dropdown.
4. In the drawer that opens, edit any of the fields of the category.
5. Once you’re done, click the Save button.

In this document, you’ll learn how to import products into your Medusa store.

## Overview

To import products, you must have the products in a CSV file. You can see a template of the CSV file during the import process.

{/* <Note>

TODO add link [this guide](../../modules/products/admin/import-products.mdx#csv-file)

For a list of accepted columns, refer to this guide.

</Note> */}

When you import products into your Medusa store, you’ll either create new products or update existing ones.

To import products:

1. Go to the Products page.
2. Click on the Import button at the top right.
3. In the new window:
    1. If you’re unsure of what the CSV file’s format must be like, you can download a template CSV file by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={ArrowDownTray} alt="download" /> icon.
    2. To upload the CSV file you want to import products from, either:
        1. Drag and drop the file into the dashed box;
        2. Or click on the dashed box and choose the file you want to import the products from.
    3. After you upload the CSV file:
        1. Check the number of products to be created or updated above the uploaded file’s name.
        2. You can remove the file you choose by clicking the <InlineIcon Icon={Trash} alt="trash" /> icon.
4. Once you’re done choosing a file to import products from, click on the Import List button.

This starts the import process. Based on the number of products you’re importing, it can take some time.

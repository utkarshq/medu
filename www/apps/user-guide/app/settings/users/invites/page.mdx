In this document, you'll learn how to manage invites in your store.

## Overview

To add a new user to your team, you must invite them. The user gets a notification of the invite to sign up, but you can also send them the invite link to sign up.

<Note>

The form of notification sent (for example, an email) depends on what's configured in your store. If you're unsure about this, contact your technical team to configure it for you.

</Note>

## Invite a User

To send an invite to a user:

1. Go to Settings → Users.
2. Click the Invite button.
3. Enter the user’s email and choose their role.
4. Once done, click on the "Send invite" button.

<Note title="Info">

A user's role doesn't actually change the user's privileges. All users have the same admin privileges.

</Note>

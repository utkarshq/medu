In this document, youâ€™ll get an overview of taxes in Medusa and learn about their importance.

## Overview

Taxes in Medusas are directly associated with [Regions](../regions/page.mdx). As regions and countries often have different tax rates and rules, Medusa supports specifying the tax rate for each region.

Taxes are calculated for products and shipping methods on checkout. Medusa provides a default tax provider to calculate the taxes, and merchants and developers can also integrate custom tax providers for advanced taxes calculation.

## How are Taxes Created?

When you create a region, its taxes settings are created as well.

If you specify the tax rate during the region's creation, a default tax rate is created that's applied on all products and shipping options.

## Override Tax Rates

You can create tax rates to override the default tax rate. Tax rates can be condition to products, product types, and shipping options.

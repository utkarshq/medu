In this document, you’ll get an overview of sales channels in Medusa.

## What is a Sales Channel?

A sales channel is a channel that you sell your products through. For example, you can have a sales channel for the web storefront, another for the mobile app, and another for selling across social media platforms.

By default, there’s a default sales channel in a Medusa store. You can add multiple sales channels.

## How Sales Channels Work

Sales channels are associated with data and settings in your commerce store:

- You can choose which products are available in a sales channel.
- When a customer places an order from a sales channel, the order is associated with it.
- Locations used with inventory are also associated with sales channels.

## Sales Channels Settings Overview

To view the available sales channels and settings, go to Settings → Sales channels.

The sales channels settings page shows available sales channels and allows you to manage sales channels.

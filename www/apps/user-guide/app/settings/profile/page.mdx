In this document, you’ll learn how to manage your account including editing your account details and changing the Medusa Admin's language.

## Edit Profile

To edit your profile details:

1. Go to Settings → Profile.
2. Click the Edit button.
3. In the drawer that opens:
    - You can change language of the Medusa Admin. This doesn't change the language in the whole store or for other admin users, only for your admin dashboard.
    - Medusa collects insights to understand how you use it better and improve the product. To enable/disable collecting insights, toggle the "Usage insights" field.
    - You can edit other profile information such as your first name.
4. Once done, click on the Save button.

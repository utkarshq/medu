In this document, you’ll learn how to manage the locations using the Medusa Admin.

## Overview

A location represents a physical stocking location, such as a warehouse. It's associated with a sales channel.

When fulfilling an order, you can select the location to fulfill the items from. Similarly, when requesting or handling a return, you can select the location to return the item to. This automatically increments or decrements the quantity as necessary.

An [inventory item's](../../inventory/page.mdx) quantity is set per location.

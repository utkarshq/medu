In this document, you’ll learn how to manage a region’s payment and fulfillment providers in your Medusa Admin.

<Note>

Before customers can use your payment or fulfillment provider, you must add that provider to one or more region.

</Note>

To add or remove a payment or fulfillment provider in a region:

1. Go to Settings → Regions.
2. Click on the region you want to edit.
4. Click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon at the top right of the first section.
4. Choose Edit from the dropdown.
5. In the drawer that opens and under the Providers section, change the payment and fulfillment providers of the region.
6. Once you're done, click the Save button.

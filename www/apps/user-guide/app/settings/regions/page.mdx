In this document, youâ€™ll get an overview of regions and learn about their importance in your commerce store.

## Overview

Regions are essential to your commerce store. You use regions to specify available currencies, payment providers, fulfillment providers, tax rates, and more for different regions.

Regions represent different countries that your commerce store serves customers in. A region can have multiple countries with the same settings, but a region can also be specific to a single country with its own settings.

## Currencies in Regions

Each region uses one currency, and you can set prices across your store for each region.

For example, when you create a product variant, you set the price of that variant for each currency and region in your store.

## How Customers Use Regions

When a customer browses your storefront, they choose the region based on their location. Then, the prices, shipping providers, payment providers, and taxes available and applied are based on the chosen region.

For example, if you have Stripe enabled as a payment provider in a region created for the United States, but have it disabled in a region created for European countries, only customers in the United States region can use Stripe for payment on checkout.

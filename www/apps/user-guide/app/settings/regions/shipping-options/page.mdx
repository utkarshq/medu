In this document, you’ll learn how to manage a region’s shipping options in your Medusa Admin.

## What is a Shipping Option?

A shipping option has two types:

- **Outbound**: these options are used in customers' orders. During checkout, a customer chooses one of these shipping options to receive their order. These shipping options are used when you create draft orders as well.
- **Return**: these options are used when the customer returns an item, whether the return is requested by the customer or the admin user.

## Create a Shipping Option

To create a shipping option in a region:

1. Go to Settings → Regions.
2. Under the Shipping Options section, click the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon at the top right of the section.
3. Choose Create from the dropdown.
4. In the form that opens:
    1. Under the Type section, choose the shipping option's type.
    2. To only show and use the shipping option in the admin dashboard, enable the "Admin only" field.
    3. To specify that the shipping option's price is tax-inclusive, enable the "Tax inclusive pricing" field.
    4. Specify the shipping option's name in the Name field. This name is shown to customers if "Admin only" is disabled.
    5. For the Price Type field, specify the shipping option's price type:
        - **Flat rate**: The shipping option has a fixed price. In this case, you must enter the shipping option's price in the Price field.
        - **Calculated**: The shipping option's price is calculated, meaning that the amount is shown while placing the order or creating the return.
    6. For the Shipping Profile field, specify the profile of the items that this shipping option can be used with:
        - For gift cards, choose Gift Card Profile.
        - For all other products, choose Default Shipping Profile.
    7. For the Fulfillment Provider field, choose the region's fulfillment provider used to handle the fulfillment and shipping when this shipping option is used. If you can't find a fulfillment provider, make sure to [add it to the region first](../providers/page.mdx).
    8. Under the Requirements section, you can specify a minimum and maximum cart subtotal amount. When specified, the shipping option can only be used when this condition is met.
5. Once you're done, click the Save button.

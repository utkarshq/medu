In this document, youâ€™ll get an overview of the inventory domain of the Medusa Admin.

## Overview

When a product variant's "Manage Inventory" is enabled, inventory items are created for that variant to manage its quantity.

An inventory item has different quantities for each [location](../settings/locations/page.mdx).

<Note>

The following aren't explained within this section of the user guide:

- Item allocation and locations in orders: this is explained in the [Manage Orders guide](../orders/manage/page.mdx).
- Managing general inventory of a product variant: this is explained in the [Manage Products guide](../products/manage/page.mdx).

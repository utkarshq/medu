In this document, you’ll learn how to manage an order’s payment, including capturing and refunding the payment.

## Overview

When a customer places an order, using the payment provider they choose during checkout, they authorize the payment.

The payment isn’t automatically captured. You must capture it manually from the Medusa Admin.

---

## Capture Payment

<Note>

Payment is only captured once.

</Note>

To capture an order’s payment:

1. Open the order details page.
2. Scroll to the Payments section.
3. Click on the Capture button.

## Refund Payment

<Note type="warning">

Refunding payments is irreversible.

</Note>

<Note type="check">

Payment can only be refunded if it's captured.

</Note>

{/* TODO check info after #5 */}

To refund an order’s payment:

1. Open the order details page.
2. Scroll to the Payment section.
3. Click on the <InlineIcon Icon={EllipsisHorizontal} alt="three-dots" /> icon.
4. Choose "Refund" from the dropdown.
5. In the drawer that opens:
    - Enter the amount to refund in the "Refund amount" field.
    - In the Reason field, choose a reason for the refund.
    - Optionally enter a note that the customer can view in the Note field.
    - If you don’t want the customer to receive a notification that the payment has been refunded, uncheck the “Send notifications” checkbox.
6. Once you’re done, click on the Complete button.

Check refund details in the Payment, Summary, and Timeline sections.

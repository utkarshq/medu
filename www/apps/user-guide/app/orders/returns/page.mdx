In this document, you’ll learn more about order returns, how to request a return, and more.

## Overview

Part of the order management system that Medusa provides is automating and managing order returns.

There are two ways order returns can be requested:

1. The customer requests a return for an order through the storefront, which the admin user can view on the admin.
2. The admin user requests to receive a return from the customer. The customer is informed about this through an email.

After a return is requested, the admin user chooses to either cancel the return or mark it as received. When a return is marked as received, a refund is issued to the customer.

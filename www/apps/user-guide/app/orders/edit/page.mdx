In this document, you’ll learn how to edit items in an order. This includes adding, updating, or deleting items.

## Overview

Using the Medusa Admin, you can edit an order to:

- Add a new item to the order.
- Edit the quantity of an existing item in the order.
- Delete an item from the order.

When you request an order edit, the changes aren’t saved on the order until the order edit is confirmed.

There are two ways to confirm an order edit request:

1. The customer reviews the order edit. If they accept the order edit and an additional payment is required, then they’ll have to authorize that payment. The customer can also reject the order edit;
2. Or you force-confirm the order edit. If there are any additional payment required, you have to handle that manually with the customer.

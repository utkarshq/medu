In this document, you’ll learn more about draft orders, how to create them, and more.

## Overview

Draft orders are orders created by an admin user. Products or custom items are added to the order as purchased items. You can also specify custom shipping amounts.

After a draft order is created and is marked as paid, an order is created based on that draft order and it appears as part of the Orders list.

            1. Click on the "Add products" button.
            2. In the drawer that opens, choose the products you want to add into the draft order by clicking the checkbox at the left of the product.

        3. Under the Custom Items section, you can add custom items to the draft order. To do that:

            2. To add another item, press the <Kbd>tab</Kbd> key, then enter that item's details in the new row.

            2. Or uncheck the "Same as shipping address" checkbox and enter the billing address's details.
        8. Under the Metadata section, optionally enter custom key-value pairs.
        9. Once you're done, click on the Save button.
    6. In the last step, confirm that all the information is correct:

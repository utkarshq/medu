This document showcases the module links defined between the API Key Module and other commerce modules.

## Sales Channel Module

You can create a publishable API key and associate it with a sales channel. Medusa defines a link between the `ApiKey` and the `SalesChannel` data models.

![A diagram showcasing an example of how data models from the API Key and Sales Channel modules are linked](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1709812064/Medusa%20Resources/sales-channel-api-key_zmqi2l.jpg)

This is useful to avoid passing the sales channel's ID as a parameter of every request, and instead pass the publishable API key in the header of any request to the Store API route.

Learn more about this in the [Sales Channel Module's documentation](../../sales-channel/publishable-api-keys/page.mdx).

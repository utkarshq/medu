This document showcases the module links defined between the Inventory Module and other commerce modules.

## Product Module

Each product variant has different inventory details. Medusa defines a link between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models.

A product variant whose `manage_inventory` property is enabled has an associated inventory item. Through that inventory's items relations in the Inventory Module, you can manage and check the variant's inventory quantity.

This document showcases the module links defined between the Pricing Module and other commerce modules.

## Fulfillment Module

The Fulfillment Module provides fulfillment-related functionalities, including shipping options that the customer chooses from when they place their order. However, it doesn't provide pricing-related functionalities for these options.

Medusa defines a link between the `PriceSet` and `ShippingOption` data models. A shipping option's price is stored as a price set.

## Product Module

The Product Module doesn't store or manage the prices of product variants.

Medusa defines a link between the `ProductVariant` and the `PriceSet`. A product variantâ€™s prices are stored as prices belonging to a price set.

So, when you want to add prices for a product variant, you create a price set and add the prices to it.

You can then benefit from adding rules to prices or using the `calculatePrices` method to retrieve the price of a product variant within a specified context.

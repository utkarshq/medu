In this document, you’ll learn about tax-inclusive pricing and how it's used when calculating prices.

## What is Tax-Inclusive Pricing?

A tax-inclusive price is a price of a resource that includes taxes. Medusa calculates the tax amount from the price rather than adds the amount to it.

For example, if a product’s price is $50, the tax rate is 2%, and tax-inclusive pricing is enabled, then the product's price is $49, and the applied tax amount is $1.

## How is Tax-Inclusive Pricing Set?

The [PricePreference data model](/references/pricing/PricePreference) holds the tax-inclusive setting for a context. It has two properties that indicate the context:

- `attribute`: The name of the attribute to compare against. For example, `region_id` or `currency_code`.
- `value`: The attribute’s value. For example, `reg_123` or `usd`.

<Note>

Only `region_id` and `currency_code` are supported as an `attribute` at the moment.

</Note>

The `is_tax_inclusive` property indicates whether tax-inclusivity is enabled in the specified context.

For example:

```json
{
  "attribute": "currency_code",
  "value": "USD",
  "is_tax_inclusive": true,
}
```

In this example, tax-inclusivity is enabled for the `USD` currency code.

## Tax-Inclusive Pricing in Price Calculation

### Tax Context

As mentioned in the [Price Calculation documentation](../price-calculation/page.mdx#calculation-context), The `calculatePrices` method accepts as a parameter a calculation context.

To get accurate tax results, pass the `region_id` and / or `currency_code` in the calculation context.

### Returned Tax Properties

The `calculatePrices` method returns two properties related to tax-inclusivity:

<Note title="Tip">

Learn more about the returned properties in [this guide](../price-calculation/page.mdx#returned-price-object).

</Note>

- `is_calculated_price_tax_inclusive`: Whether the selected `calculated_price` is tax-inclusive.
- `is_original_price_tax_inclusive` : Whether the selected `original_price` is tax-inclusive.

A price is considered tax-inclusive if:

1. It belongs to the region or currency code specified in the calculation context;
2. and the region or currency code has a price preference with `is_tax_inclusive` enabled.

### Tax Context Precedence

A region’s price preference’s `is_tax_inclusive`'s value takes higher precedence in determining whether a price is tax-inclusive if:

- both the `region_id` and `currency_code` are provided in the calculation context;
- the selected price belongs to the region;
- and the region has a price preference

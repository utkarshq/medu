In this document, youâ€™ll learn about the main concepts in the Pricing Module.

## Price Set

A [PriceSet](/references/pricing/models/PriceSet) represents a collection of prices that are linked to a resource (for example, a product or a shipping option).

Each of these prices are represented by the [Price data module](/references/pricing/models/Price).

## Price List

A [PriceList](/references/pricing/models/PriceList) is a group of prices only enabled if their conditions and rules are satisfied.

A price list has optional `start_date` and `end_date` properties that indicate the date range in which a price list can be applied.

Its associated prices are represented by the `Price` data model.

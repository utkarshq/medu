In this document, you'll learn about order edits.

## What is an Order Edit?

A merchant can edit an order to add new items or change the quantity of existing items in the order.

An order edit is represented by the [OrderChange data model](/references/order/models/OrderChange).

The `OrderChange` data model is associated with any type of change, including a return or exchange. However, its `change_type` property distinguishes the type of change it's making.

In the case of an order edit, the `OrderChange`'s type is `edit`.

## Add Items in an Order Edit

When the merchant adds new items to the order in the order edit, the item is added as an [OrderItem](/references/order/models/OrderItem).

Also, an `OrderChangeAction` is created. The [OrderChangeAction data model](/references/order/models/OrderChangeAction) represents a change made by an `OrderChange`, such as an item added.

So, when an item is added, an `OrderChangeAction` is created with the type `ITEM_ADD`. In its `details` property, the item's ID, price, and quantity are stored.

## Update Items in an Order Edit

A merchant can update an existing item's quantity or price.

This change is added as an `OrderChangeAction` with the type `ITEM_UPDATE`. In its `details` property, the item's ID, new price, and new quantity are stored.

---

## Shipping Methods of New Items in the Edit

Adding new items to the order requires adding shipping methods for those items.

These shipping methods are represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderItem). Also, an `OrderChangeAction` is created with the type `SHIPPING_ADD`

---

## How Order Edits Impact an Order’s Version

When an order edit is confirmed, the order’s version is incremented.

---

## Payments and Refunds for Order Edit Changes

Once the Order Edit is confirmed, any additional payment or refund required can be made on the original order.

This is determined by the comparison between the `OrderSummary` and the order's transactions, as mentioned in [this guide](../transactions/page.mdx#checking-outstanding-amount).

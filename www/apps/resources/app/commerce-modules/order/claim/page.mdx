In this document, you’ll learn about order claims.

## What is a Claim?

When a customer receives a defective or incorrect item, the merchant can create a claim to refund or replace the item.

The [OrderClaim data model](/references/order/models/OrderClaim) represents a claim.

---

## Claim Type

The `Claim` data model has a `type` property whose value indicates the type of the claim:

- `refund`: the items are returned, and the customer is refunded.
- `replace`: the items are returned, and the customer receives new items.

---

## Old and Replacement Items

When the claim is created, a return, represented by the [Return data model](/references/order/models/Return), is also created to handle receiving the old items from the customer.

<Note>

Learn more about returns in [this guide](../return/page.mdx).

</Note>

If the claim’s type is `replace`, replacement items are represented by the [ClaimItem data model](/references/order/models/OrderClaimItem).

---

## Claim Shipping Methods

A claim uses shipping methods to send the replacement items to the customer. These methods are represented by the [OrderShippingMethod data model](/references/order/models/OrderShippingMethod).

The shipping methods for the returned items are associated with the claim's return, as explained in [this guide](../return/page.mdx#return-shipping-methods).

---

## Claim Refund

If the claim’s type is `refund`, the amount to be refunded is stored in the `refund_amount` property.

The [Transaction data model](/references/order/models/OrderTransaction) represents the refunds made for the claim.

---

## How Claims Impact an Order’s Version

When a claim is confirmed, the order’s version is incremented.

In this document, you'll learn about the Order Change data model and possible actions in it.

## OrderChange Data Model

The [OrderChange data model](/references/order/models/OrderChange) represents any kind of change to an order, such as a return, exchange, or edit.

Its `change_type` property indicates what the order change is created for:

1. `edit`: The order change is making edits to the order, as explained in [this guide](../edit/page.mdx).
2. `exchange`: The order change is associated with an exchange, which you can learn about in [this guide](../exchange/page.mdx).
3. `claim`: The order change is associated with a claim, which you can learn about in [this guide](../claim/page.mdx).
4. `return_request` or `return_receive`: The order change is associated with a return, which you can learn about in [this guide](../return/page.mdx).

Once the order change is confirmed, its changes are applied on the order.

## Order Change Actions

The actions to perform on the original order by a change, such as adding an item, are represented by the [OrderChangeAction data model](/references/order/models/OrderChangeAction).

The `OrderChangeAction` has an `action` property that indicates the type of action to perform on the order, and a `details` property that holds more details related to the action.

The following table lists the possible `action` values that Medusa uses and what `details` they carry.

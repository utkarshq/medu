In this section of the documentation, you'll find guides and references related to Medusa's commerce modules.

A commerce module provides features for a commerce domain within its service. The Medusa application exposes these features in its API routes to clients.

A commerce module also defines data models, representing tables in the database. Medusa's framework and tools allow you to extend these data models to add custom fields.

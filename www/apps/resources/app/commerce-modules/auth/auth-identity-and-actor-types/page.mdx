In this document, youâ€™ll learn about concepts related to identity and actors in the Auth Module.

## What is an Auth Identity?

The [AuthIdentity data model](/references/auth/models/AuthIdentity) represents a user registered by an [authentication provider](../auth-providers/page.mdx).

When a user is registered using an authentication provider, it creates a record of `AuthIdentity`.

Then, when the user logs-in in the future with the same authentication provider, the associated auth identity is used to validate their credentials.

## Actor Types

An actor type is a type of user that can be authenticated.

The Auth Module doesn't store or manage any user-like models, such as for customers or users.

Instead, the user types are created and managed by other modules. For example, a customer is managed by the Customer Module.

Then, when an auth identity is created for the actor type, the ID of the user is stored in the `app_metadata` property of the auth identity.

For example, an auth identity of a customer has the following `app_metadata` property:

```json
{
  "app_metadata": {
    "customer_id": "cus_123"
  }
}
```

The ID of the user is stored in the key `{actor_type}_id` of the `app_metadata` property.

## Protect Routes by Actor Type

When you protect routes with the `authenticate` middleware, you specify in its first parameter the actor type that must be authenticated to access the specified API routes.

For example:

export const highlights = [
  ["11", `"user"`, "The actor type that must be authenticated to access the specified routes."]
]

```ts title="src/api/middlewares.ts" highlights={highlights}
import { 
  defineMiddlewares,
  authenticate,
} from "@medusajs/framework/http"

export default defineMiddlewares({
  routes: [
    {
      matcher: "/custom/admin*",
      middlewares: [
        authenticate("user", ["session", "bearer", "api-key"]),
      ],
    },
  ],
})
```

By specifying `user` as the first parameter of `authenticate`, only authenticated users of actor type `user` (admin users) can access API routes starting with `/custom/admin`.

## Custom Actor Types

You can define custom actor types that allows a custom user, managed by your custom module, to authenticate into Medusa.

For example, if you have a custom module with a `Manager` data model, you can authenticate managers with the `manager` actor type.

Learn how to create a custom actor type in [this guide](../create-actor-type/page.mdx).

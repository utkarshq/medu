In this document, youâ€™ll learn what publishable API keys are and how to use them with sales channels.

## Publishable API Keys with Sales Channels

A publishable API key, provided by the API Key Module, is a client key scoped to one or more sales channels.

When sending a request to a Store API route, you must pass a publishable API key in the header of the request:

```bash
curl http://localhost:9000/store/products \
  x-publishable-api-key: {your_publishable_api_key}
```

The Medusa application infers the associated sales channels and ensures that only data relevant to the sales channel are used.

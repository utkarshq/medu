## What is a Campaign?

A [Campaign](/references/promotion/models/Campaign) combines promotions under the same conditions, such as start and end dates.

## Campaign Limits

Each campaign has a budget represented by the [CampaignBudget data model](/references/promotion/models/CampaignBudget). The budget limits how many times the promotion can be used.

There are two types of budgets:

- `spend`: An amount that, when crossed, the promotion becomes unusable. For example, if the amount limit is set to `$100`, and the total amount of usage of this promotion crosses that threshold, the promotion can no longer be applied.
- `usage`: The number of times that a promotion can be used. For example, if the usage limit is set to `10`, the promotion can be used only 10 times by customers. After that, it can no longer be applied.

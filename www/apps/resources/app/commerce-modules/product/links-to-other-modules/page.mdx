This document showcases the module links defined between the Product Module and other commerce modules.

## Pricing Module

The Product Module doesn't provide pricing-related features.

Instead, Medusa defines a link between the `ProductVariant` and the `PriceSet` data models. A product variantâ€™s prices are stored belonging to a price set.

So, to add prices for a product variant, create a price set and add the prices to it.

## Inventory Module

The Inventory Module provides inventory-management features for any stock-kept item.

Medusa defines a link between the `ProductVariant` and `InventoryItem` data models. Each product variant has different inventory details.

When the `manage_inventory` property of a product variant is enabled, you can manage the variant's inventory in different locations through this relation.

This document showcases the module links defined between the Payment Module and other commerce modules.

## Cart Module

The Cart Module provides cart-related features, but not payment processing.

Medusa defines a link between the `Cart` and `PaymentCollection` data models. A cart has a payment collection which holds all the authorized payment sessions and payments made related to the cart.

Learn more about this relation in [this documentation](../payment-collection/page.mdx#usage-with-the-cart-module).

## Order Module

An order's payment details are stored in a payment collection. This also applies for claims and exchanges.

So, Medusa defines links between the `PaymentCollection` data model and the `Order`, `OrderClaim`, and `OrderExchange` data models.

## Region Module

You can specify for each region which payment providers are available. The Medusa application defines a link between the `PaymentProvider` and the `Region` data models.

This increases the flexibility of your store. For example, you only show during checkout the payment providers associated with the cart's region.

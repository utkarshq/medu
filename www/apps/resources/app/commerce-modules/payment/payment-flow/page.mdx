In this document, you’ll learn how to implement an accept-payment flow using the Payment Module's main service.

## 1. Create a Payment Collection

A payment collection holds all details related to a resource’s payment operations. So, you start off by creating a payment collection.

For example:

```ts
const paymentCollection =
  await paymentModuleService.createPaymentCollections({
    region_id: "reg_123",
    currency_code: "usd",
    amount: 5000,
  })
```

<Note title="Tip">

Learn more about the `createPaymentCollections` method in [this reference](/references/payment/createPaymentCollections).

</Note>

Then, create a link between the payment collection and the resource it's storing payment details for, such as a cart in the Cart Module:

```ts
import { 
  ContainerRegistrationKeys,
  Modules,
} from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

// ...

// resolve the remote link
const remoteLink = container.resolve(
  ContainerRegistrationKeys
)

remoteLink.create({
  [Modules.CART]: {
    cart_id: "cart_123",
  },
  [Modules.PAYMENT]: {
    payment_collection_id: paymentCollection.id,
  },
})
```

## 2. Create Payment Sessions

The payment collection has one or more payment sessions, each being a payment amount to be authorized by a payment provider.

So, after creating the payment collection, create at least one payment session for a provider.

For example:

```ts
const paymentSession =
  await paymentModuleService.createPaymentSession(
    paymentCollection.id,
    {
      provider_id: "stripe",
      currency_code: "usd",
      amount: 5000,
      data: {
        // any necessary data for the
        // payment provider
      },
    }
  )
```

<Note>

</Note>

## 3. Authorize Payment Session

Once the customer chooses a payment session, start the authorization process. This may involve some action performed by the third-party payment provider, such as entering a 3DS code.

For example:

```ts
const payment =
  await paymentModuleService.authorizePaymentSession(
    paymentSession.id,
    {}
  )
```

When the payment authorization is successful, a payment is created and returned.

<Note>

Learn more about the `authorizePaymentSession` method in [this reference](/references/payment/authorizePaymentSession).

</Note>

### Handling Additional Action

If the payment authorization isn’t successful, whether because it requires additional action or for another reason, the method updates the payment session with the new status and throws an error.

In that case, you can catch that error and, if the session's `status` property is `requires_more`, handle the additional action, then retry the authorization.

For example:

```ts
try {
  const payment =
    await paymentModuleService.authorizePaymentSession(
      paymentSession.id,
      {}
    )
} catch (e) {
  // retrieve the payment session again
  const updatedPaymentSession = (
    await paymentModuleService.listPaymentSessions({
      id: [paymentSession.id],
    })
  )[0]

  if (updatedPaymentSession.status === "requires_more") {
    // TODO perform required action
    // TODO authorize payment again.
  }
}
```

---

## 4. Payment Flow Complete

The payment flow is complete once the payment session is authorized and the payment is created.

You can then use the payment to capture the amount using the [capturePayment method](/references/payment/capturePayment). You can also refund captured amounts using the [refundPayment method](/references/payment/refundPayment).

<Note>

Some payment providers allow capturing the payment automatically once it’s authorized. In that case, you don’t need to do it manually.

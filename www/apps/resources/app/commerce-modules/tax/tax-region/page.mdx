## What is a Tax Region?

A tax region, represented by the [TaxRegion data model](/references/tax/models/TaxRegion), stores tax settings related to a region that your store serves.

Tax regions can inherit settings and rules from a parent tax region.

Each tax region has tax rules and a tax provider.

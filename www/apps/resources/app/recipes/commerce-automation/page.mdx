This recipe provides the general steps to implement commerce automation with Medusa.

## Overview

Commerce automation is essential for businesses to save costs, provide a better user experience, and avoid manual, repetitive tasks that lead to human errors. Businesses utilize automation in different domains, including marketing, customer support, and order management.

Medusa provides the necessary architecture and tools to implement commerce automation for order management, customer service, and more. You can perform an asynchronous action when an event is triggered, schedule a job that runs at a specified interval, and more.

## Re-Stock Notifications

Customers may be interested in a product that is currently out of stock. The following guide explains how to add restock notifications in your Medusa application:

## Automated Customer Support

Customer support is essential to build a store's brand and customer loyalty. This can include integrating with third-party services or automating notifications sent to customers when changes happen related to their orders, returns, exchanges, and more.

You can use the Notification Module to send notifications when an action is triggered, such as when a customer or their order is updated.

{/* <Note title="Tip">

The [Events reference](../../events-reference/page.mdx) shows an extensive list of events triggered by the each commerce module.

</Note> */}

Medusa also provides Notification Module Providers that integrate with third-party services, such as SendGrid.

## Automatic Data Synchronization

As your commerce store grows, you'll likely need to synchronize data across different systems. For example, you need to synchronize data with an ERP system or a data warehouse.

To implement that:

- Create a workflow that implements the synchronization steps, along with retry and rollback logic.
- Create a scheduled job that executes the workflow automatically at the specified time pattern.

<Details summaryContent="Example: Synchronizing products with a third-party service">

  For example, create the file `src/workflows/sync-products.ts` with the following content:

export const syncProductsWorkflowHighlight = [
  ["20", "retrieveStoreStep", "A step that retrieves the store by its ID."],
  ["36", "retrieveProductsToUpdateStep", "A step that retrieves the products to update based on a last update date."],
  ["56", "syncProductsStep", "A step to sync the product with a third-party service."],

      const storeModuleService: IStoreModuleService = 
        container.resolve(Modules.STORE)

      await storeModuleService.updateStores(id, {
        metadata: {

        },
      })
    }
  )

  type SyncProductsWorkflowInput = {
    store_id: string
  }

  export const syncProductsWorkflow = createWorkflow(
      "sync-products-workflow",
      function ({ store_id }: SyncProductsWorkflowInput) {
        const { store } = retrieveStoreStep({
          id: store_id,
        })

        const { products } = retrieveProductsToUpdateStep({
          last_sync_date: store.metadata.last_sync_date,
        })

        syncProductsStep({
          products,
        })

        updateStoreLastSyncStep({
          store,
        })
      }
    )
  ```

  This creates a workflow with the following steps:

  1. Retrieve the store by its ID.
  2. Retrieve products to update based on the last date and time the products were synced. The last sync date is retrieved from the store's `metadata` property.
  3. Sync the retrieved products with a third-party service. It's assumed that the connection to the third-party service is implemented within a custom module's main service.
  4. Update the last sync date of the store to the current date.

  Then, create a scheduled job at `src/jobs/sync-products.ts` that executes the workflow at the specified interval:

  ```ts
  import { MedusaContainer } from "@medusajs/framework/types"
  import { 
    syncProductsWorkflow,
  } from "../workflows/sync-products"

  export default async function syncProductsJob(
    container: MedusaContainer
  ) {
    await syncProductsWorkflow(container)
    .run({
      input: {
        name: "John",
      },
    })
  }

  export const config = {
    name: "sync-products",
    // execute every minute
    schedule: "0 0 * * *",
    numberOfExecutions: 3,
  }
  ```

## Order Management Automation

Using Medusa's architecture and commerce features, you can automate a large amount of order management functionalities.

To handle events within an order flow and automate actions, create a subscriber. For example, create a subscriber that listens to the `order.placed` event and automatically creates a fulfillment if predefined conditions are met.

<Note type="soon">

The `order.placed` event is currently not emitted.

## Automated RMA Flow

Businesses must optimize their Return Merchandise Authorization (RMA) flow to ensure a good customer experience and service. By automating the flow, customers request to return their received items, and businesses quickly support them.

Medusa's commerce features are geared towards automating RMA flows and ensuring a good customer experience:

- Customers can create order returns from the storefront. Merchants then receive a notification and handle the return from the Medusa Admin.
- Merchants can make order changes and request the customer's approval for them. The customer can also send any additional payment if necessary.
- Every order-related action triggers an event, which you can listen to with a subscriber. This allows you to handle order events to automate actions.

## Customer Segmentation

Businesses use customer segmentation to organize customers into different groups and then apply different price rules to these groups.

Medusa's commerce modules provide the necessary features to implement this use case:

- The Customer Module provides a customer groups feature to organize customers into customer groups.
- The Pricing Module provides the features to specify prices based on a condition, such as the group of the customer.

For example, to group customers with over twenty orders:

1. Create a subscriber that listens to the `order.placed` event.
2. If the customer has more than 20 orders, add them to the VIP customer group.

<Note type="soon">

The `order.placed` event is currently not emitted.

<Details summaryContent="Example: Add customer to VIP group">

  Here’s an example of a subscriber that listens to the `order.placed` event and checks whether the customer should be added to the VIP customer group based on their number of orders:

  <Note type="soon">

  The `order.placed` event is currently not emitted.

  </Note>

  ```ts title="src/subscribers/add-custom-to-vip.ts" collapsibleLines="1-12" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"

  export default async function orderCreatedHandler({
    event: { data },
    container,
  }: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
    const orderId = data.id

    const orderModuleService: IOrderModuleService = container
      .resolve(Modules.ORDER)

    const customerModuleService: 
      ICustomerModuleService = container.resolve(
        Modules.CUSTOMER
      )

    // check if VIP group exists
    const vipGroup = await customerModuleService
      .listCustomerGroups({
        name: "VIP",
      }, {
        relations: ["customers"],

    if (!vipGroup.length) {
      return
    }

    // retrieve the order
    const order = await orderModuleService.retrieveOrder(orderId)

    if (!order || 
      !order.customer_id || 
      vipGroup[0].customers.find(
        (customer) => customer.id === order.customer_id
      ) !== undefined) {
      return
    }

    const [, count] = await orderModuleService.listAndCountOrders({
      customer_id: order.customer_id,
    })

    if (count < 20) {
      return
    }

    // add customer to VIP group
    await customerModuleService.addCustomerToGroup({
      customer_group_id: vipGroup[0].id,
      customer_id: order.customer_id,
    })
  }

  export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
    event: "order.placed",
  }
  ```

## Marketing Automation

In your commerce store, you may utilize marketing strategies that encourage customers to make purchases. For example, you send a newsletter when new products are added to your store.

To do that, create a subscriber that listens to the `product.created`, and send an email to subscribed customers with tools like SendGrid or Mailchimp.

You can also create a scheduled job that checks whether the number of new products has exceeded a set threshold, then sends out the newsletter.

<CardList items={[
  {
    href: "!docs!/learn/fundamentals/events-and-subscribers",
    title: "Create a Subscriber",
    text: "Learn how to create a subscriber in Medusa.",
    icon: AcademicCapSolid,
  },
  {
    href: "!docs!/learn/fundamentals/scheduled-jobs",
    title: "Scheduled Jobs",
    text: "Learn how to create a scheduled job in Medusa.",
    icon: AcademicCapSolid,
  },
]} />

<Details summaryContent="Example: Sending a newsletter email after adding ten products">

  For example, create the file `src/subscribers/send-products-newsletter.ts` with the following content:

export const newsletterHighlights = [
  ["32", "store", "Retrieve the first store in the application."],
  ["34", "products", "Retrieve the products created since the last newsletter send date."],
  ["40", "", "Check whether more than 10 products have been created before proceeding."],
  ["44", "customers", "Retrieve all customers, assuming they're considered subscribed."],
  ["46", "createNotifications", "Send a notification (newsletter) to each customer using the Notification Module."],
  ["49", '"email"', "Send the notification through the email channel."],
  ["50", '"newsletter_template"', "Specify the template name in the third-party service (for example, SendGrid)."],
  ["52", "products", "Pass the created products to the template."],
  ["57", "updateStores", "Update the store's `last_newsletter_send_date` property with the current date."]
]

  ```ts title="src/subscribers/send-products-newsletter.ts" highlights={newsletterHighlights} collapsibleLines="1-14" expandButtonLabel="Show Imports"
  import type {
    SubscriberArgs,
    SubscriberConfig,
  } from "@medusajs/framework"
  import { 
    Modules,
  } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"
  import { 
    ICustomerModuleService, 
    IProductModuleService, 
    IStoreModuleService,
    INotificationModuleService,
  } from "@medusajs/framework/types"

  export default async function productCreateHandler({
    container,
  }: SubscriberArgs<{ id: string }>) {
    const productModuleService: IProductModuleService = 
      container.resolve(Modules.PRODUCT)

    const storeModuleService: IStoreModuleService = 
      container.resolve(Modules.STORE)

    const customerModuleService: ICustomerModuleService = 
      container.resolve(Modules.CUSTOMER)

    const notificationModuleService:
      INotificationModuleService = container.resolve(
        Modules.NOTIFICATION
      )

    const store = (await storeModuleService.listStores())[0]

    const products = await productModuleService.listProducts({
      created_at: {
        $gt: store.metadata.last_newsletter_send_date,
      },
    })

    if (products.length < 10) {
      return
    }

    const customers = await customerModuleService.listCustomers()

    await notificationModuleService.createNotifications(
      customers.map((customer) => ({
        to: customer.email,
        channel: "email",
        template: "newsletter_template",
        data: {
          products,
        },
      }))
    )

    await storeModuleService.updateStores(store.id, {
      metadata: {
        last_newsletter_send_date: (new Date()).toString(),
      },
    })
  }

  export const config: SubscriberConfig = {
    event: "product.created",
  }
  ```

  In the subscriber function, you:

  1. Retrieve the first store in our application.
  2. Retrieve products created since the last time a newsletter is sent. The last send date is stored in the store's `metadata` property.
  3. If the count of last created products is less than 10, stop execution.
  4. Retrieve all customers. Here, it's assumed that all customers are considered subscribed for simplicity.
  5. Use the Notification Module to send a notification to the customer. This uses the Notification Module Provider configured for the `email` channel.
  6. Update the store's `last_newsletter_send_date` with the current date.

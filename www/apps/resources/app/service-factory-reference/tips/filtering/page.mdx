# {metadata.title}

Many of the service factory's generated methods allow passing filters to perform an operation, such as to update or delete records matching the filters.

This guide provides examples of using filters.

<Note>

The `list` method is used in the example snippets of this reference, but you can use the same filtering mechanism with any method that accepts filters.

</Note>

---

## Match Exact Value

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  name: "My Post 2",
})
```

If you pass a property with its value, only records whose properties exactly match the value are selected.

In the example above, only posts having the name `My Post 2` are retrieved.

---

## Match Multiple Values

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  views: [
    50,
    100,
  ],
})
```

To find records with a property matching multiple values, pass an array of those values as the property's value in the filter.

In the example above, only posts having either `50` or `100` views are retrieved.

---

## Don't Match Values

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  name: {
    $nin: [
      "My Post",
    ],
  },
})
```

To find records with a property that doesn't match one or more values, pass an object with a `$nin` property. Its value is an array of multiple values that a record's property shouldn't match.

In the example above, only posts that don't have the name `My Post` are retrieved.

---

## Match Text Like Value

<Note>

This filter only applies to text-like properties, including `id` and `enum` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  name: {
    $like: "My%",
  },
})
```

To perform a `like` filter on a record's property, set the property's value to an object with a `$like` property. Its value is the string to use when applying the `like` filter.

The example above matches all posts whose name starts with `My`.

---

## Apply Range Filters

<Note>

This filter only applies to the `number` and `dateTime` properties.

</Note>

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: {
    $lt: new Date(),
  },
})
```

To filter a record's property to be within a range, set the property's value to an object with any of the following properties:

1. `$lt`: The property's value must be less than the supplied value.
2. `$lte`: The property's value must be less than or equal to the supplied value.
3. `$gt`: The property's value must be greater than the supplied value.
4. `$gte`: The property's value must be greater than or equal the supplied value.

In the example above, only posts whose `published_at` property is before the current date and time are retrieved.

### Example: Retrieve Posts Published Today

```ts
const startToday = new Date()
startToday.setHours(0, 0, 0, 0)

const endToday = new Date()
endToday.setHours(23, 59, 59, 59)

const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  published_at: {
    $gte: startToday,
    $lte: endToday,
  },
})
```

The `dateTime` property also stores the time. So, when matching for an exact day, you must set a range filter to be between the beginning and end of the day.

In this example, you retrieve the current date twice: once to set its time to `00:00:00`, and another to set its time `23:59:59`. Then, you retrieve posts whose `published_at` property is between `00:00:00` and `23:59:59` of today.

---

## Apply Or Condition

```ts
const posts = await postModuleService.listPosts({
  $or: [
    {
      name: "My Post",
    },
    {
      published_at: {
        $lt: new Date(),
      },
    },
  ],
})
```

To use an `or` condition, pass to the filter object the `$or` property, whose value is an array of filters.

In the example above, posts whose name is `My Post` or their `published_at` date is less than the current date and time are retrieved.

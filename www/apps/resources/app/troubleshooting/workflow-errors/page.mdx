## When-Then Error: Handler for action X Not Found

The following error may occur in production if you use a `when-then` block in your workflow:

```plain
custom-workflow:when-then-01JE8Z0M1FXSE2NCK1G04S0RR2:invoke - Handler for action \"when-then-01JE8Z0M1FXSE2NCK1G04S0RR2\" not found...
```

This occurs if the `when-then` block doesn't return a step's result and doesn't have a name specified. You can resolve it by passing a name as a first parameter of `when`:

```ts
const result = when(
  "custom-when-condition"
  // ... rest of the parameters
)
```

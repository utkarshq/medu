By default, passing the `--with-nextjs-starter` to the `create-medusa-app` command starts both the Medusa application at `localhost:9000` and the Next.js Starter storefront at `localhost:8000` once the installation finishes successfully. The Medusa Admin also opens in your default browser.

If, while following along the setup process, you try to access the Next.js storefront and it's not working, try to run the storefront manually while the Medusa application is still running.

To do that, first, change to the directory of the storefront. The directory name is `{project_name}-storefront`, where `{project_name}` is the name you chose for the project while running the `create-medusa-app` command. For example:

```bash
cd my-medusa-store-storefront
```

Then, run the following command to start the storefront:

```bash npm2yarn
npm run dev
```

The storefront runs on `localhost:8000` now.

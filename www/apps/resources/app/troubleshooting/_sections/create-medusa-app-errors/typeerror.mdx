This error typically occurs when you set up a Medusa project with `create-medusa-app` and try to run the Medusa application.

To resolve this issue, make sure you change into the application's directory of the Medusa project you created before trying to start the Medusa application:

```bash npm2yarn
cd my-medusa-store
npm run dev
```

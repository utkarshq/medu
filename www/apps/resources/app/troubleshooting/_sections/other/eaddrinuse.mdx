When you run your Medusa application you may run to an error similar to the following:

```bash
code: 'EADDRINUSE',
errno: -48,
syscall: 'Listen',
address: '::',
port: 9000
```

This means that there's another process running at port `9000`. You need to either:

- Change the default port used by the Medusa application. You can do that by setting the `PORT` environment variable to a new port. When you do this, make sure to change the port used in other apps that interact with your Medusa application, such as in your [admin](/references/medusa-config#admin) or [storefront](../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx#change-medusa-application-url).
- Terminate other processes running on port `9000`.

If you are experiencing connection issues when trying to access your Medusa application from a storefront or the admin dashboard, it is most likely due to Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

You might see a log in your browser console, that looks like this:

![CORS error log](https://res.cloudinary.com/dza7lstvk/image/upload/v1668003322/Medusa%20Docs/Other/jnHK115_udgf2n.png)

In your `medusa-config.ts`, ensure that you've configured your CORS settings correctly:

```ts title="medusa-config.ts"
module.exports = defineConfig({
  projectConfig: {
    http: {
      storeCors: process.env.STORE_CORS || "http://localhost:8000",
      adminCors: process.env.ADMIN_CORS || "http://localhost:9000",
      authCors: process.env.AUTH_CORS || "http://localhost:8000,http://localhost:9000",
    },
    // ...
  },
})
```

Learn more about these configurations in [this documentation](/references/medusa-config#http).

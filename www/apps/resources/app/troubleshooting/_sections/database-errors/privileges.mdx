The database user you use in the `databaseUrl` Medusa backend configuration must have create privileges. Otherwise, you'll face problems when running migrations.

If you're using the `postgres` superuser, then it should have these privileges by default. Otherwise, make sure to grant your user create privileges. You can learn how to do that in [PostgreSQL's documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl-priv.html).

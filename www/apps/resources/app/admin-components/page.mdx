In this section, you'll find examples of implementing common Medusa Admin components and layouts.

These components are useful to follow the same design conventions as the Medusa Admin, and are build on top of the [Medusa UI package](!ui!).

Refer to the [Medusa UI documentation](!ui!) for a full list of components.

## Layouts

Use these components to set the layout of your UI route.

<ChildDocs showItems={["Layouts"]} onlyTopLevel={false} />

## Components

Use these components in your widgets and UI routes.

<ChildDocs showItems={["Components"]} onlyTopLevel={false} />

You can integrate any third-party service to Medusa, including storage services, notification systems, Content-Management Systems (CMS), etcâ€¦ By integrating third-party services, you build flows and synchronize data around these integrations, making Medusa not only your commerce application, but a middleware layer between your data sources and operations.

Medusa provides integrations out-of-the-box that are listed here, but you can also create your own integrations, such as integrating ERP systems, as explained in [this guide](!docs!/learn/customization/integrate-systems).

## Auth

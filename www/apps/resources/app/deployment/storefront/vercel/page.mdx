In this document, you’ll learn how to deploy the Next.js storefront to [Vercel](https://vercel.com).

<Prerequisites items={[
  {
    text: "Storefront codebase hosted in a GitHub repository.",
    link: "../../../nextjs-starter/page.mdx"
  },
  {
    text: "Deployed Medusa application with at least one region.",
    link: "../../page.mdx#medusa-application"
  },
]} />

## 1. Create Vercel Project

On your Vercel dashboard:

1. Click on the Add New button at the top right.
2. Choose Project from the dropdown.
3. In the list of repositories, click on the Import button of the storefront’s repository.

This opens a form to configure your project.

### Configure Storefront Project

In the Configure Project form, choose Next.js for the Framework Preset field. This sets for you the build and install scripts, and the output directory

<Details summaryContent="Expected Values">

- `build` script:
    
```bash npm2yarn
npm run build
```

- `install` script:

```bash npm2yarn
npm install
```

- output directory: `.next`

</Details>

Then, expand the Environment Variables section and add the following variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL= # URL of Medusa application
NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION=us # or a different region that you prefer
NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY= # publishable API key of the storefront's sales channel
REVALIDATE_SECRET=supersecret # TODO generate random string
```

Where:

1. `NEXT_PUBLIC_MEDUSA_BACKEND_URL` is the URL of your deployed Medusa application
2. `NEXT_PUBLIC_DEFAULT_REGION` is the country code of a region to be used by default, if the customer hasn’t selected a region.
3. `NEXT_PUBLIC_PUBLISHABLE_KEY` is the publishable API key of the storefront. You can create one or find the default one in the Medusa Admin dashboard.
4. `REVALIDATE_SECRET` is a random string for [Next.js revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#on-demand-revalidation).

Make sure to add other relevant environment variables. For example, if you’re using the Stripe Payment Module Provider in the Medusa application, add the `NEXT_PUBLIC_STRIPE_KEY` environment variable.

### Deploy Application

Click the  Deploy button when you’re done. The deployment will take a few minutes.

Once the deployment is done, there’s still more work to do before you can use the storefront. Click on the Continue to Dashboard button to go to the project’s dashboard.

---

## 2. Set Storefront URL

Vercel generates a random domain name for your project. You can use it or [set a custom domain name](https://vercel.com/guides/how-do-i-add-a-custom-domain-to-my-vercel-project).

<Note title="Tip">

Find your generated domain name at Settings → Domains in your project’s dashboard.

</Note>

Once you have your domain name:

1. Go to Settings → Environment Variables
2. Add a new environment variable:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=https://nextjs-storefront...
```

Set the value to the storefront’s URL.

### Set STORE_CORS and AUTH_CORS in Deployed Medusa Application

You must also set the `STORE_CORS` environment variable in your Medusa application to the storefront’s URL:

```bash
STORE_CORS=https://nextjs-storefront...
```

<Note title="Tip">

If you have multiple storefront URLs, separate them by commas in `STORE_CORS`

</Note>

And add the URL to `AUTH_CORS`'s value:

```bash
AUTH_CORS=<OTHER_URLS>,https://nextjs-storefront...
```

Where `<OTHER_URLS>` are other storefront or admin URLs added previously to `AUTH_CORS`. 

### Redeploy Storefront

Once the environment variables changes are deployed in the Medusa application, do the following to redeploy the storefront:

1. Go to Deployments in the storefront Vercel project.
2. Find the last production deployment, and click on the three dots icon at the right.
3. Choose Redeploy from the dropdown, and confirm redeployment in the new window.

## Test the Deployed Storefront

Once the redeployment is done, test out the storefront by going to its URL. Try to browse the products or place an order to ensure everything is working as expected.

## Troubleshooting

If you’re running into issues in your storefront, find the logs in your Vercel project’s dashboard under the Logs tab.

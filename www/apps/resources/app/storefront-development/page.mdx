The Medusa application is made up of a Node.js service and an admin dashboard. The storefront is installed, built, and hosted separately from the Medusa application, providing you with the flexibility to choose the frontend tech stack that you and your team are proficient in, and implement unique design systems and user experience. 

<Note>

Learn more about Medusa's architecture in [this documentation](!docs!/learn/introduction/architecture).

</Note>

You can build your storefront from scratch, or built it on top of the [Next.js Starter storefront](../nextjs-starter/page.mdx). This section of the documentation provides guides to help you build a storefront from scratch for your Medusa application.

At Medusa, we strive to provide the best experience for developers using our platform. For that reason, Medusa collects anonymous and non-sensitive data that provides a global understanding of how users are using Medusa.

---

## Purpose

As an open source solution, we work closely and constantly interact with our community to ensure that we provide the best experience for everyone using Medusa. 

We are capable of getting a general understanding of how developers use Medusa and what general issues they run into through different means such as our Discord server, GitHub issues and discussions, and occasional one-on-one sessions.

However, although these methods can be insightful, they’re not enough to get a full and global understanding of how developers are using Medusa, especially in production.

Collecting this data allows us to understand certain details such as:

- What operating system do most Medusa developers use?
- What version of Medusa is widely used?
- What parts of the Medusa Admin are generally undiscovered by our users?
- How much data do users manage through our Medusa Admin? Is it being used for large number of products, orders, and other types of data?
- What Node version is globally used? Should we focus our efforts on providing support for versions that we don’t currently support?

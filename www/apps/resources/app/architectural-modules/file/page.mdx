## What is a File Module Provider?

The File Module exposes the functionalities to upload assets, such as product images, to the Medusa application. A file module provider implements the underlying logic of handling uploads and downloads of assets, such as integrating third-party services. The File Module must have one file module provider configured.

By default, Medusa uses the Local File Module. This module uploads files to the `uploads` directory of your Medusa application.

This is useful for development. However, for production, itâ€™s highly recommended to use other File Modules, such as the S3 Module.

# computed Method - DML Reference

This method indicated that the property is a computed property.
Computed properties are not stored in the database but are
computed on the fly.

## Example

```ts
import { model } from "@medusajs/framework/utils"

const MyCustom = model.define("my_custom", {
 calculated_price: model.bigNumber().computed(),
 // ...
})

export default MyCustom
```
